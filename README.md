# Random Forest from Scratch
This project tries to recreate the random forest regressor model of sklearn as a programming exercise. 
The created model is then benchmarked together with the standard regressor from sklearn to see how succeessful the implementation was in comparison.
As a final point, I want to analyze how sklearns implementation differs from mine and how that results in the benchmark differences.
